# IP_Project
This project aims to develop a gesture recognition system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict sign language actions from videos. The system can handle videos of varying durations and accurately identify the represented gestures, contributing to improved accessibility for hearing-impaired individuals.
